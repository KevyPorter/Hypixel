        <h1>Index</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website with some functions working with the Hypixel Public API. This website is not affiliated with Hypixel Network and is purely made for educational purposes. If you'd like to use the Hypixel API yourself, see the links in the footer for more information.</p><br /><br />
        
        <h1>Spin-off</h1>
        <p>By adding your Minecraft name you will be remembered in the database. The stats will still be live from Hypixel, but you will be added to Players and Leaderboards (see menu up header). Why am I doing this? I do not want to overload the API, so I limited it in a way so that visitors could compare themselves to other visitors. People can obviously add other people, but that's not that big of a problem. This also creats an unique spin-off.</p><br /><br />
